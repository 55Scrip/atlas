# Atlas Decision Log

This log records architectural decisions that shape future development.

## 2026-06-29: Keep Sprint 36 as a Foundation Sprint

Decision: establish boundaries, canonical entities, docs, CI, hooks, and AI
interfaces without rewriting existing engines.

Rationale: Atlas already has working deterministic engines. A large migration
would add risk without improving the investor experience.

## 2026-06-29: Use Python Backend as the Source of Truth

Decision: keep existing backend code under `atlas/` and document `backend/` as
the backend boundary.

Rationale: this preserves all existing APIs and test coverage while making the
repository easier to navigate.

## 2026-06-29: Add Strict TypeScript Configuration Before Frontend Code

Decision: add `frontend/tsconfig.json` and `frontend/package.json` with strict
type checking, but no frontend runtime.

Rationale: future UI work should start from strong defaults without forcing an
application framework too early.

## 2026-06-29: Define AI as Interfaces First

Decision: create `atlas.ai` protocols for reasoning, knowledge, summary,
discovery, and decision support services.

Rationale: Atlas should remain deterministic and explainable until concrete AI
services can be evaluated against the Constitution.

## 2026-06-29: Build Portfolio as the First Real Domain

Decision: implement deterministic portfolio calculations, validation, and
structured observations inside `atlas.domains.portfolio`.

Rationale: portfolio understanding is foundational to Atlas. A portfolio is not
just a list of positions; it is a collection of investment decisions. The domain
therefore starts with value, allocation, concentration, and data quality before
any user-facing action language.
