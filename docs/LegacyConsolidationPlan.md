# Atlas Legacy Engine Consolidation Plan

**Created:** 2026-07-01 (Sprint 74)  
**Updated:** 2026-07-01 (Sprint 80)  
**Status:** Active — Sprint 80 target complete; Sprint 81 target to be selected

This document inventories all legacy Atlas modules, maps their current runtime
usage, documents overlap with Blueprint-aligned domains and capabilities, and
identifies the safest first migration target for Sprint 75.

---

## Background

Atlas has two parallel layers:

**Blueprint-aligned (current):**
- `atlas/domains/` — canonical concepts and contracts
- `atlas/capabilities/` — product capabilities
- `atlas/adapters/` — bridges between legacy and domain types
- `atlas/shared/` — immutable canonical entities
- `atlas/providers/` — opt-in market data (not called by demo)

**Legacy (compatibility, not for expansion):**
- All other top-level modules under `atlas/` — original working engines
- Remain functional and fully tested
- CLI commands exist for many; some are actively used

The goal of consolidation is to reduce the legacy surface area over time,
not to delete working code abruptly. Each migration must be testable,
deterministic, and leave the CLI interface unchanged or clearly improved.

## Legacy Module Inventory

### Group A — Thin Shims / Re-exports

| Module | Files | Lines | Description | Runtime CLI usage | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~`atlas/daily/`~~ | ~~2~~ | ~~43~~ | ~~Re-exports `atlas.daily_brief` under a stable path~~ | ~~`atlas daily brief`~~ | **Removed Sprint 75** |
| ~~`atlas/daily_brief/`~~ | ~~2~~ | ~~353~~ | ~~Legacy DailyBriefEngine (provider-dependent, 11 sub-engines)~~ | ~~`atlas daily brief` (deprecated Sprint 76)~~ | **Removed Sprint 77** |

`atlas/daily/` is a pure re-export shim. It imports from `atlas/daily_brief/`
and re-exports under the `atlas.daily` name. The only CLI consumer is
`atlas daily brief` (the legacy command). `atlas daily summary` is the
Blueprint-aligned equivalent and does not touch either module.

`atlas/daily_brief/` is the legacy engine that:
- imports `atlas.analysis.portfolio`, `atlas.analysis.watchlist`
- calls a `CompanyDataProvider` (mock or Yahoo)
- composes 11 sub-engines at runtime
- is distinct from `atlas/capabilities/daily_brief/` (the current engine)

**Note:** `atlas/domains/daily_brief/__init__.py` currently imports from
`atlas.daily_brief` — a boundary violation. The domain layer should not import
from legacy modules. This is a known tech debt item.

### Group B — Provider-Dependent Legacy Commands (medium risk)

| Module | Files | Lines | Description | Runtime CLI usage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `atlas/analysis/` | 18 | 1985 | Company, portfolio, watchlist, memory, scoring engines | `atlas analyze`, `atlas watchlist analyze` (deprecated 78), `atlas portfolio analyze` (deprecated 79), etc. |
| `atlas/home/` | 2 | 625 | AtlasHomeEngine — top-level dashboard aggregator | `atlas home` |
| `atlas/dashboard/` | 2 | 528 | DashboardEngine — weekly dashboard | `atlas dashboard show` |
| `atlas/intelligence/` | 2 | 470 | IntelligenceEngine — company intelligence | `atlas intelligence analyze` |
| `atlas/watchlist_review/` | 2 | 901 | WatchlistReviewEngine | `atlas watchlist review` |
| `atlas/portfolio_review/` | 2 | 635 | PortfolioReviewEngine | `atlas portfolio review` |
| `atlas/comparison/` | 2 | 1032 | ComparisonEngine — multi-company comparison | `atlas compare` |
| `atlas/themes/` | 2 | 569 | ThemeEngine | `atlas theme analyze` |
| `atlas/market/` | 3 | 793 | MarketSnapshot, MarketHealthEngine, MarketRegimeEngine | `atlas market analyze`, `atlas market health` |

All Group B modules:
- require a `CompanyDataProvider` at runtime (mock or Yahoo Finance)
- are provider-coupled by design
- have no Blueprint-aligned equivalent capability yet
- are functional and tested

### Group C — Self-Contained Analytics (targeted migration candidates)

| Module | Files | Lines | Description | Runtime CLI usage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `atlas/evidence/` | 2 | 563 | EvidenceQualityEngine — scores evidence claims | `atlas evidence assess` |
| `atlas/reasoning/` | 2 | 591 | ReasoningEngine — structured reasoning output | `atlas reason analyze` |
| `atlas/risk/` | 2 | 469 | RiskEngine, PositionSizingInput | `atlas risk size` |
| `atlas/risk_drift/` | 2 | 682 | RiskDriftEngine — position drift detection | `atlas risk-drift analyze` |
| `atlas/economics/` | 2 | 532 | EconomicSignalsEngine | `atlas economics analyze` |
| `atlas/language/` | 2 | 493 | AtlasLanguageEngine — output language calibration | Used internally by `daily_brief` |
| `atlas/monitoring/` | 2 | 626 | MonitoringEngine — alert generation | `atlas monitor` |
| `atlas/principles/` | 2 | 360 | PrinciplesEngine — investment principle check | `atlas principles check` |
| `atlas/suitability/` | 2 | 635 | SuitabilityEngine — investor suitability | `atlas suitability analyze` |

Group C modules are largely self-contained: they do not depend on providers,
and they operate on structured input rather than live data. Several are good
candidates for a future Blueprint-aligned capability wrapper.

### Group D — Infrastructure / Support (leave unchanged)

| Module | Files | Lines | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `atlas/services/` | 4 | 164 | Database service, company service, financial import | SQLite persistence layer |
| `atlas/memory/` | 4 | 219 | MemoryEngine, MemoryStore — ticker-level memory entries | Used by `atlas memory save/show/compare` |
| `atlas/profile/` | 2 | 294 | InvestorProfile — investor context | Used widely across legacy commands |
| `atlas/decision_journal/` | 2 | ~200 | Journal entry logging | Used by `atlas journal create/list/review` |
| `atlas/conversation/` | 2 | 526 | ConversationEngine — Q&A sessions | `atlas ask` |

Group D provides foundation infrastructure. No migration needed; these serve
specific functions with no Blueprint-aligned equivalent in scope.

## Blueprint Overlap Summary

| Legacy module | Blueprint equivalent | Overlap status |
|---|---|---|
| `atlas/daily/` + `atlas/daily_brief/` | `atlas/capabilities/daily_brief/` | Full overlap — two parallel implementations. CLI command `atlas daily brief` uses legacy; `atlas daily summary` uses Blueprint. |
| `atlas/analysis/portfolio.py` | `atlas/domains/portfolio/` + `atlas/adapters/portfolio.py` | Partial — Portfolio type bridged via adapter. Domain summary is the current path. |
| `atlas/analysis/watchlist.py` | `atlas/capabilities/watchlist_intelligence/` | Deprecated — `atlas watchlist analyze` deprecated Sprint 78; `WatchlistEngine` still used by monitoring, decision, intelligence, conversation, watchlist_review legacy engines. |
| `atlas/analysis/company_analysis.py` | `atlas/capabilities/company_analysis/` | Partial — new capability path exists for export pipeline. |
| `atlas/domains/daily_brief/` | `atlas/capabilities/daily_brief/` | **Boundary violation:** `atlas/domains/daily_brief/__init__.py` imports from `atlas.daily_brief` (legacy). The domain layer should not depend on legacy modules. |

### Boundary Violation Identified

`atlas/domains/daily_brief/__init__.py` imports from `atlas.daily_brief`:

```python
from atlas.daily_brief import DailyBriefEngine, DailyBriefInput, DailyBriefOutput
```

This makes a Blueprint domain depend on a legacy module — the reverse of the
intended dependency direction. No CLI command or test currently imports from
`atlas.domains.daily_brief` directly (confirmed by grep), so the violation
is dormant but should be resolved when the legacy daily_brief module is
eventually retired.

---

## Provider Safety Confirmation

- Providers (`atlas/providers/`) are never imported by:
  - `atlas/domains/`
  - `atlas/capabilities/`
  - `atlas/adapters/`
  - demo script (`scripts/run_daily_brief_demo.sh`)
  - release verification script (`scripts/verify_release_candidate.sh`)
- Providers are only called from legacy CLI commands that explicitly pass
  `--provider mock` or `--provider yahoo` at the command line
- Default for all legacy provider commands is `--provider mock`
- `atlas daily summary` (current path) makes zero provider calls

Provider safety: **confirmed**.

## Sprint 80 Migration Target — COMPLETED

### Completed: `atlas portfolio review` command deprecated

**Sprint 80 result:**
- `atlas portfolio review` CLI command now prints a deprecation message and exits cleanly (exit 0)
- `PortfolioReviewEngine`, `PortfolioReviewInput`, `render_portfolio_review` removed from `atlas/cli/main.py` imports
- `atlas portfolio summary` (Blueprint-aligned) is the sole supported portfolio command
- `atlas portfolio analyze` remains deprecated from Sprint 79 — confirmed unchanged
- `atlas/portfolio_review/` engine remains on disk; no CLI command calls it
- 10 new Sprint 80 deprecation tests; 1028 tests passing, 0 failures

**`PortfolioReviewEngine` isolation:** module on disk, no longer imported by any CLI command.
Still referenced by `atlas/home/engine.py` (AtlasHomeEngine) — see Group B legacy engines.

**Future removal criteria for `atlas portfolio review` command:**
1. Remove command body entirely in Sprint 81 (or leave deprecated stub)
2. `PortfolioReviewEngine` deletion requires retiring `AtlasHomeEngine` (Group B)

---

## Sprint 79 Migration Target — COMPLETED

### Completed: `atlas portfolio analyze` command deprecated

**Sprint 79 result:**
- `atlas portfolio analyze` CLI command now prints a deprecation message and exits cleanly (exit 0)
- `PortfolioIntelligenceEngine` and `render_portfolio_analysis` removed from `atlas/cli/main.py` imports
- `atlas portfolio summary` (Blueprint-aligned, no provider calls) is the current supported command
- `atlas portfolio review` is **unchanged** — separate legacy path, not in Sprint 79 scope
- `atlas/analysis/portfolio.py` remains on disk; `Portfolio` type still used by summary and review commands
- 10 new Sprint 79 deprecation tests; 1018 tests passing, 0 failures

**`atlas portfolio review` status:** unchanged. It still uses the legacy `PortfolioReviewEngine`.
This is separate technical debt documented for a future sprint.

**Future removal criteria for `atlas portfolio analyze` command:**
1. Remove command body entirely in Sprint 80 (or leave deprecated stub)
2. `PortfolioIntelligenceEngine` deletion safe once `atlas portfolio review` and other consumers are retired

---

## Sprint 78 Migration Target — COMPLETED

### Completed: `atlas watchlist analyze` command deprecated

**Sprint 78 result:**
- `atlas watchlist analyze` CLI command now prints a deprecation message and exits cleanly (exit 0)
- `WatchlistEngine` and `render_watchlist_analysis` removed from `atlas/cli/main.py` module-level imports
- `atlas watchlist intelligence` (Blueprint-aligned) is the current supported command
- `atlas/analysis/watchlist.py` engine remains on disk — still used by 5 other legacy engines
  (`monitoring`, `decision`, `intelligence`, `conversation`, `watchlist_review`)
- 10 new Sprint 78 deprecation tests added; 1008 tests passing, 0 failures

**Note:** `WatchlistEngine` cannot be deleted yet — it has 5 active legacy engine consumers.
The CLI command deprecation reduces CLI surface area; full engine removal requires a broader
legacy consolidation plan for those dependent engines.

**Future removal criteria for `atlas watchlist analyze` command:**
1. Remove the command body entirely in Sprint 79 (or leave deprecated stub — low risk)
2. `WatchlistEngine` deletion requires retiring all 5 dependent legacy engines first

---

## Sprint 77 Migration Target — COMPLETED

### Completed: `atlas/daily_brief/` legacy engine deleted

**Sprint 77 result:**
- `atlas/daily_brief/` (2 files, 353 lines) deleted
- `tests/test_daily_brief.py` rewritten: 6 legacy engine tests removed; 1 CLI deprecation test retained
- 3 new architecture guardrail tests added to `test_architecture_boundaries.py`:
  - `test_atlas_daily_brief_engine_is_removed` — directory must not exist
  - `test_atlas_daily_brief_is_not_importable` — import must raise `ModuleNotFoundError`
  - `test_no_active_code_imports_atlas_daily_brief` — static scan of all source files
- 998 tests passing, 0 failures. Demo + RC verification both green.
- `atlas.daily_brief` is now fully removed from the codebase.

**Net reduction:** 353 lines of provider-coupled legacy code eliminated.

---

## Sprint 76 Migration Target — COMPLETED

### Completed: `atlas daily brief` command deprecated

**Sprint 76 result:**
- `atlas daily brief` CLI command now prints a deprecation message and exits cleanly (exit 0)
- Legacy `DailyBriefEngine` is no longer called by any CLI command
- `from atlas.daily_brief import ...` removed from `atlas/cli/main.py` module-level imports
- `atlas daily summary` (Blueprint-aligned) is the current supported command
- `atlas/daily_brief/` engine module remains on disk, isolated — no command calls it
- 10 new Sprint 76 deprecation tests added; 1001 tests passing, 0 failures

**Provider safety:** deprecated command makes zero provider calls (no `DailyBriefEngine` instantiated).

**Future removal criteria for `atlas/daily_brief/`:**
1. Confirm no external scripts import `atlas.daily_brief` directly (grep confirms only CLI did)
2. Remove `atlas daily brief` command entirely (not just deprecate)
3. Delete `atlas/daily_brief/` (2 files, 353 lines) in a future sprint
4. Suggested sprint: Sprint 77 or later

---

## Sprint 75 Migration Target — COMPLETED

### Completed: `atlas/daily/` shim removal + `atlas/domains/daily_brief/` boundary fix

**Sprint 75 result:**
- `atlas/daily/` deleted (2 files, 43 lines)
- `atlas/cli/main.py` updated to import from `atlas.daily_brief` directly
- `tests/test_daily_brief.py` updated to import from `atlas.daily_brief` directly
- `atlas/domains/daily_brief/__init__.py` rewritten as a minimal namespace stub
  (no imports from legacy OR capabilities — pure domain namespace placeholder)
- `test_domains_do_not_import_capabilities_or_providers_or_legacy` extended with
  explicit legacy prefix list (`atlas.daily`, `atlas.daily_brief`, `atlas.analysis`, etc.)
- 2 new Sprint 75 boundary tests added: `test_atlas_daily_shim_is_removed`,
  `test_domains_daily_brief_does_not_import_legacy`
- 991 tests passing, 0 failures. Demo + RC verification both green.

### Selected Target (original):

**Rationale:**

`atlas/daily/` is a two-file, 43-line pure re-export shim with no logic:

```python
# atlas/daily/__init__.py
from atlas.daily_brief import (
    DailyBriefEngine, DailyBriefInput, ...
)
```

It exists solely to give `atlas.daily` a stable import path. The only CLI
consumer is `atlas daily brief` (legacy command), which can import from
`atlas.daily_brief` directly without the shim.

**Simultaneously**, `atlas/domains/daily_brief/__init__.py` imports from
`atlas.daily_brief` — a boundary violation. Since no external code imports
from `atlas.domains.daily_brief`, this file can be updated to export from
`atlas.capabilities.daily_brief` instead (or left as-is if the domain
boundary module is removed entirely).

**What Sprint 75 would do:**

1. Update `atlas/cli/main.py` to import `DailyBriefEngine`, `DailyBriefInput`,
   `render_daily_brief` from `atlas.daily_brief` directly (removing the
   `atlas.daily` shim import)
2. Fix `atlas/domains/daily_brief/__init__.py` to either:
   - re-export from `atlas.capabilities.daily_brief` (correct direction), or
   - be removed if no code uses it
3. Delete `atlas/daily/` (2 files, 43 lines)
4. Update any test imports

**This does NOT:**
- Change the `atlas daily brief` command behavior
- Touch `atlas/daily_brief/` (the legacy engine itself)
- Change the `atlas daily summary` command (Blueprint-aligned, untouched)
- Introduce any new capability

**Risk level: LOW**
- 43 lines removed, 0 logic changed
- Full test suite confirms no regressions
- The shim has no logic — it is purely a re-export

### Runner-up Target: `atlas/domains/daily_brief/` boundary fix only

If the `atlas/daily/` removal is considered too broad for Sprint 75, the
boundary violation fix alone (updating `atlas/domains/daily_brief/__init__.py`
to not import from a legacy module) is an even smaller, safer change.

---

## Migration Risk Summary

| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Import breakage | `atlas.daily` removed; any external code using it breaks | Grep confirms only `atlas/cli/main.py` imports `atlas.daily`; fix is in same sprint |
| Test failures | Tests importing `atlas.daily` | Only `tests/test_daily_brief.py` imports from `atlas.daily_brief` (not `atlas.daily`); risk is low |
| Boundary re-introduction | Future sprint re-introduces domain → legacy import | Add architecture boundary test asserting domains do not import legacy modules |
| Scope creep | Sprint expands to touch `atlas/daily_brief/` engine | Sprint 75 explicitly excludes the daily_brief engine; only the shim is removed |

---

## Full Technical Debt Inventory (Updated)

| Area | Description | Priority | Suggested Sprint |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~`atlas/daily/` shim~~ | ~~43-line re-export; removed~~ | ~~High~~ | **Done 75** |
| ~~`atlas/domains/daily_brief/` boundary violation~~ | ~~Fixed: namespace stub~~ | ~~High~~ | **Done 75** |
| ~~`atlas daily brief` command~~ | ~~Deprecated; no longer calls engine~~ | ~~High~~ | **Done 76** |
| ~~`atlas/daily_brief/` legacy engine~~ | ~~Provider-coupled; deleted~~ | ~~Medium~~ | **Done 77** |
| `atlas/analysis/watchlist.py` — CLI command deprecated | `atlas watchlist analyze` deprecated; WatchlistEngine still used by 5 legacy engines | Medium | 79 (CLI removal); broader engine migration later |
| `atlas/analysis/portfolio.py` legacy type | Bridged via adapter; could be retired after full portfolio migration | Medium | Future |
| Group C self-contained modules | `evidence`, `reasoning`, `risk`, etc. — good candidates for Blueprint wrappers | Low | Multi-sprint |
| Provider-coupled Group B | `home`, `dashboard`, `comparison`, etc. — require provider architecture decision | Low | Long-term |
| Legacy engine consolidation (test coverage) | Ensure legacy commands retain tests during migration | Ongoing | Each sprint |
